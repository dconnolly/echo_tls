- In Section 7.2 of ECH RFC, the backend computes accept_confirmation by
    applying HKDF-Expand-Label, HKDF-Extract and generating a transcript hash.
  Is the hash algorithm used for these three the same as the TLS hash or is it
  the one from the ECH config ?

- Is it mandatory for the OuterClientHello to have the same cipher suite
  (hash alg and aead alg) than the InnerClientHello or can they be different ?
  If they must be the same, can you point me in the RFC ? (I want to add it in
  comment in the code)
