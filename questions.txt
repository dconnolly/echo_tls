- In Section 7.2 of ECH RFC, the backend computes accept_confirmation by
    applying HKDF-Expand-Label, HKDF-Extract and generating a transcript hash.
  Is the hash algorithm used for these three the same as the TLS hash or is it
  the one from the ECH config ?
    ANSWER: It's the TLS hash

- Is it mandatory for the OuterClientHello to have the same cipher suite
  (hash alg and aead alg) than the InnerClientHello or can they be different ?
  If they must be the same, can you point me in the RFC ? (I want to add it in
  comment in the code)
    ANSWER : No

- Assume that the client send an client hello with an encrypted_client_hello extension
  that passes all the checks (the one from Section 7.1). Assume that in the inner client
  hello, there are the proper cipher suite as well as a key share for the DH group.
  However, assume that in the outer client hello, there is no key share for the DH group.
  What should be the behavior of the frontend server ?
  By reading the RFC, I have the impression that once the check on the encrypted_client_hello
  extension extension are successful, the frontend server does not check anything else and
  just forwards the inner_client_hello to the Backend.
    ANSWER : If decryption works, the front end does not check anything.

- in the same type of question: there is not requirement that the group of the outer
  is the same as the group of the inner ?

- Another question related to early data and HRR (both for TLS and ECH): If an HRR is sent,
  does the server ignores necessarily the early data that was sent by the client or can he still uses them ?
