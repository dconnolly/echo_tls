- In Section 7.2 of ECH RFC, the backend computes accept_confirmation by
    applying HKDF-Expand-Label, HKDF-Extract and generating a transcript hash.
  Is the hash algorithm used for these three the same as the TLS hash or is it
  the one from the ECH config ?
    ANSWER: It's the TLS hash

- Is it mandatory for the OuterClientHello to have the same cipher suite
  (hash alg and aead alg) than the InnerClientHello or can they be different ?
  If they must be the same, can you point me in the RFC ? (I want to add it in
  comment in the code)
    ANSWER : No

- Assume that the client send an client hello with an encrypted_client_hello extension
  that passes all the checks (the one from Section 7.1). Assume that in the inner client
  hello, there are the proper cipher suite as well as a key share for the DH group.
  However, assume that in the outer client hello, there is no key share for the DH group.
  What should be the behavior of the frontend server ?
  By reading the RFC, I have the impression that once the check on the encrypted_client_hello
  extension extension are successful, the frontend server does not check anything else and
  just forwards the inner_client_hello to the Backend.
    ANSWER : If decryption works, the front end does not check anything.

- In RFC, itâ€™s written:
  When the client offers the "early_data" extension in
         ClientHelloInner, it MUST also include the "early_data" extension
         in ClientHelloOuter.  This allows servers that reject ECH and use
         ClientHelloOuter to safely ignore any early data sent by the
         client per [RFC8446], Section 4.2.10.

  Does that mean that the front end must verify this when he decrypts the inner ?
    ANSWER : No -- if the inner decrypts, it doesn't need to check anything in the outer

- in the same type of question: there is not requirement that the group of the outer
  is the same as the group of the inner ?
    ANSWER : Yes, there is no requirement.

- Another question related to early data and HRR (both for TLS and ECH): If an HRR is sent,
  does the server ignores necessarily the early data that was sent by the client or can he still uses them ?
    ANSWER: The server ignores the data

-  From what I understood, the client can send CH + early data + end_of_early_data messages
  directly as a stream of message before receiving an answer from the server. If the server
  sends an HRR then it will ignores the data as you said. But what does he do with the
  end_of_early_data ? This one being part of the transcript normally, does it includes it or not ?
    ANSWER :
      If the server does not send an "early_data"
     extension in EncryptedExtensions, then the client MUST NOT send an
     EndOfEarlyData message.

- What error should the server send if the client only offers cipher suite that the server
  does not accept / recognize ?
    ANSWER : handshake_failure

- if the server refuses PSK and does not ask for a client certificate then even if
  the handshake terminates, he does not really know with whom is he talking right ?
