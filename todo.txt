----- Todo list -----

- Add the application data part of the tls model.
- Update the generation of retry config. Currently the retry config is generated
	but not saved anywhere.
- Add the safety check for ECH client that send outdated ECH config.
- Add an extra field to EE (in addition to ECH_retry) and prove privacy on it.
- Add old security property from TLS model
- Add a security property modelling safe against downgrade attack
- WARNING : The sending of HRR request in ECH has been changed with respect to the
	random
- Model post handshake authentication



----- Scenario -----

- Equivalence between grease and not grease
	-> No HRR

-> Reachability property concerning the handshake :
		-> Remove Early
		-> Remove PH Authentication
		-> Remove PH Data

		-> No compromise Certificate Key
		->


-> High private key
		-> No PSK, No Client Certificate TLS1.3
		-> No PSK, No Client Certificate ECH
		-> PSK, TLS1.3
		-> PSK, ECH
		-> Same with TLS1.3 + ECH

		->

		-> No PSK,
