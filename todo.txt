----- Todo list -----

- Currently, the outer client must have an empty psk extension.
	Need to update the model when it will be confirmed that the outer client shall
	contain a psk extension.

	@ Chris : Could you indicate here what shall be contained in the psk extension
	of the outer client and how shall it be used ?

- Add the handling of the HRR by ECH server and client.

- Add the safety check properties.

- Add the application data part of the tls model.

- Add the different error messages. Lot of them are missing.

- Update the generation of retry config. Currently the retry config is generated
	but not saved anywhere.

- Add the initialisation of the different tables:
		* Long term keys
		* Pre shared keys
		* Ech config

- Add Security properties

- Add Grease in Client echo

- Add compromised keys

----- Done ----
