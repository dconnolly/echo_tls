----- Current Status -----

Equivalence takes too much time / space (more than 8 hours + 260 Go and it did not terminate)
Need to investigate how to either make the clause faster / speedup the termination.

----- Todo list -----

- Currently, the outer client must have an empty psk extension.
	Need to update the model when it will be confirmed that the outer client shall
	contain a psk extension.

	@ Chris : Could you indicate here what shall be contained in the psk extension
	of the outer client and how shall it be used ?

- Add the handling of the HRR by ECH server and client.

- Add the application data part of the tls model.

- Add the different error messages. Lot of them are missing.

- Update the generation of retry config. Currently the retry config is generated
	but not saved anywhere.

- Add Security properties

- Add the safety check for ECH client that send outdated ECH config.

- Add compromised keys

- Add multiple ECH configuration

- Try to prove client privacy in normal TLS and Echo
	echo_client(false,use_psk,true,diff[c_domA,c_domB],BackendA,tls_g,tls_h,tls_a,ech_conf,empty_extra_ext,empty_extra_ext)
	Change the Server so that he does not take the client domain as argument

- Privacy of the inner extra field (give input by attacker)
		in(io,x);
		in(io,y);
		client(diff[x,y])

- Add an extra field to EE (in addition to ECH_retry) and prove privacy on it.

- Unlinkability of the client:
	!
	in(io,c_domA);
	in(io,c_domB);
	standard_client(true,send_kex,diff[c_domA,c_domB],s_dom,tls_g,tls_h,tls_a,empty_extra_ext)

	! new k ! P \equiv ! new k; P

- New PSK system for outer:
		- If there is an psk extension in the inner there should be one in the outer.
		- Value of the psk extension: two bitstring
		- CFS ignores the outer psk if inner accepted otherwise do as TLS extension as usual

-

----- Done ----

- Add the initialisation of the different tables:
		* Long term keys
		* Pre shared keys
		* Ech config

- Add the safety check properties.

- Add Grease in Client echo

- Add the safety check for Grease.
